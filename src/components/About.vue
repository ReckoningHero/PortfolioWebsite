          I’m Joshua D. Nguyen, a developer with two years of experience in IT and software development, complemented by a passion for GameDev. My love for gaming, sparked by classics like the SNES and N64, inspired me to pursue a career in creating the games I’ve always enjoyed. From designing levels to coding mechanics, I’m fascinated by the creative and technical process behind the scenes.
          <br /><br />
          I’ve honed my skills through personal projects in Unity and Unreal Engine, blending my passion for creativity and problem-solving. My professional background in agile environments and DevOps has equipped me with collaborative skills, technical expertise, and a commitment to delivering stable, high-quality solutions.
          <br /><br />
          When I’m not coding, you can find me running, exploring new restaurants, collecting video games and movies, or diving into manga and anime. I’m also a car enthusiast with a dream of owning a Dodge Challenger someday. My goal is to bring my love of games and technical expertise together to contribute to the ever-evolving world of game development.
